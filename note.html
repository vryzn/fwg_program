Thank you for joining us.</p><br><p>We are so happy to share with this story of Doug and Kayleen, two friends who form an intimate relationship through their injuries, both emotional and physical. From their youth into their adulthood, experience the comical love story that dives deeper into their humanity.</p><br>
		 <p>Our characters here are fictional, but their stories are real. Our show consists of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and mental health. We bring you this show to shine a light on mental health awareness and hope to spark conversation amongst the community.</p><br>
 		<p>All of our cast and crew are in compliance with Northeastern University COVID safety guidelines.</p><br><p>Gruesome Playground Injuries would not be possible with the help and support of New Renaissance Theatre Company and their supporters. We thank you for coming tonight and enjoy the show!</p><br>
