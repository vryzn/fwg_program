      <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Shannonn</h6>
      <p class="card-text">Siddhie is a third year political science and business admin major who hates talking about herself because she never has any idea what to say. This is her first production with New Ren and she’s had such a blast playing Shannon over the past few months. She’s sure she has other hobbies but stress running lines for the show has kind of taken over her life at the moment. Siddhie would like to thank everyone involved in the production for making this show absolutely incredible, but also wants to shout out Chloe, Indu, Livy, and Brooke for their amazing directing, producing, and managing. This show couldn’t have been what it was without the cast and crew and she’s incredibly grateful to all the hard work everyone has put into it. She really hopes you’ll enjoy the show! Lastly she’d like to make the point that surfing in the L.A. river is entirely possible and anyone who can’t simply isn’t applying themselves enough. </p>

      <p class="card-text">Jonathan is a third-year student studying Political Science and Economics, the most soul-crushing combination of subjects he could think of. Luckily for him, gingers don’t have souls, so he’s doing okay. This is Jonathan’s third production with New Renaissance Theatre Co., after having the pleasure to portray Present-Day Doug in Gruesome Playground Injuries and to direct last semester’s production of Beheld. You may also recognize him as Fortnight’s “Mac & Cheese Guy.” Jonathan would like to thank just about everyone in cast, crew, and beyond, but he’d like to give special shoutouts to Chloe for her incredible work on every last aspect of production, to Livy for being the only reason anything ever works smoothly, and to Indu for enabling his caffeine addiction like a true friend should. He’s had an absolute ball of a time with this show, and he hopes you enjoy watching it as much as he did working on it!

He would like to thank Chloe for being the bestest peer pressuring director for making him do this show. He would also like to thank his girl-boss girlfriend Suzy for being super awesome and amazing. If you give him flowers at the end of the show, please give them to Suzy on his behalf. Don’t ask why. Yay mechanical engineering! (P.S. catch him surfing in the L.A. river this summer)</p>

      <p class="card-text">Chloe has had the pleasure of directing this incredible cast and crew these past months, and she can’t imagine a better way to close out her time at Northeastern. Last spring she directed Henry IV, Part I with Northeastern Shakespeare Society, which ignited a passion for directing. She is so grateful to New Renaissance for giving her a chance to direct once more. She plans to graduate with a B.S. in Behavioral Neuroscience and pursue Genetic Counseling. She is so grateful to Brooke’s sweatshirt (and Brooke) for inspiring the concept for this play and for being an amazing assistant. She would also like to thank the producer, Indu, and stage managers, Livy & Ember, without them this production wouldn’t exist!
