      <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Shannon</h6>
      <p class="card-text">Siddhie is a third year political science and business admin major who hates talking about herself because she never has any idea what to say. This is her first production with New Ren and she’s had such a blast playing Shannon over the past few months. She’s sure she has other hobbies but stress running lines for the show has kind of taken over her life at the moment. Siddhie would like to thank everyone involved in the production for making this show absolutely incredible, but also wants to shout out Chloe, Indu, Livy, and Brooke for their amazing directing, producing, and managing. This show couldn’t have been what it was without the cast and crew and she’s incredibly grateful to all the hard work everyone has put into it. She really hopes you’ll enjoy the show! Lastly she’d like to make the point that surfing in the L.A. river is entirely possible and anyone who can’t simply isn’t applying themselves enough. </p>

      <p class="card-text">Jonathan is a third-year student studying Political Science and Economics, the most soul-crushing combination of subjects he could think of. Luckily for him, gingers don’t have souls, so he’s doing okay. This is Jonathan’s third production with New Renaissance Theatre Co., after having the pleasure to portray Present-Day Doug in Gruesome Playground Injuries and to direct last semester’s production of Beheld. You may also recognize him as Fortnight’s “Mac & Cheese Guy.” Jonathan would like to thank just about everyone in cast, crew, and beyond, but he’d like to give special shoutouts to Chloe for her incredible work on every last aspect of production, to Livy for being the only reason anything ever works smoothly, and to Indu for enabling his caffeine addiction like a true friend should. He’s had an absolute ball of a time with this show, and he hopes you enjoy watching it as much as he did working on it!

      <p class="card-text">Violet is a first year grad student studying education at Northeastern. Violet is incredibly honored to be playing Leah in this production alongside such a talented cast and crew! Developing and playing this character has been such a joy, and nothing else has given her such a strong feeling of empowerment quite like this! Her previous acting work includes filmed and virtual original works of Lost Boy (Wendy), Rules of Reign (Alicina), and she most recently played Ellen in Vinegar Tom who has a similar vibe to Leah! Violet would like to thank everyone involved in this production for bringing such creativity, community, and cheerfulness into her life (extra special shout out to Chloe, Brooke, and Livy for their dedication to fantastic directing, staging, and organization!) She hopes most of all that you walk away from the show with some new perspectives!

He would like to thank Chloe for being the bestest peer pressuring director for making him do this show. He would also like to thank his girl-boss girlfriend Suzy for being super awesome and amazing. If you give him flowers at the end of the show, please give them to Suzy on his behalf. Don’t ask why. Yay mechanical engineering! (P.S. catch him surfing in the L.A. river this summer)</p>

      <p class="card-text">Chloe has had the pleasure of directing this incredible cast and crew these past months, and she can’t imagine a better way to close out her time at Northeastern. Last spring she directed Henry IV, Part I with Northeastern Shakespeare Society, which ignited a passion for directing. She is so grateful to New Renaissance for giving her a chance to direct once more. She plans to graduate with a B.S. in Behavioral Neuroscience and pursue Genetic Counseling. She is so grateful to Brooke’s sweatshirt (and Brooke) for inspiring the concept for this play and for being an amazing assistant. She would also like to thank the producer, Indu, and stage managers, Livy & Ember, without them this production wouldn’t exist!

She has a history of working backstage throughout high school in productions such as Chicago and The Addams Family. The warm and caring community within New Ren has made her first production at Northeastern a wonderful experience that she hopes to continue in the future!

This is Ember’s first production with New Renaissance and they are so excited to be a part of such a welcoming, kind, and overall amazing cast and crew! They would like to thank New Ren for the wonderful opportunity to work on this show. They would also like to thank Chloe, Brooke, and Livy for being great leaders and for helping them get into the swing of things after joining a bit late into the process. They are glad this team has been able to shed light on tough themes and open the audience to different perspectives!</p>

However, Northeastern should be reimbursing her soon. If you want to help Eshna out, please find her after the show and give her $3.17 so she can afford lunch tomorrow. You should ask her about the time she turned a boy into a puppet (see Isaac’s bio)! She would like to thank her shopping buddy, Jordan and their car. Please enjoy this production and if you see a prop you like, be sure to know in your heart that it was bought by Eshna.

Growing up in New Jersey and living in Boston has heightened their senses. They started off as a small fledgling, similar to a baby bird, unsure and unaware of the world. But now they are like a hawk: ready with sharp eyes and a sense of when to strike. This is especially helpful when making their way on to the T and jaywalking in front of cars to get to class (and blocking too, I guess). </p>

He has spent enough time in the shadows hidden under that alias and is ready to reclaim what he once hid from. He wants you to question as he once did: are you man or a muppet (or rather puppet!)?

You can catch her beauty on Saturdays and Wednesdays from 10:00pm to 2:00am. She would like to shout out Tamara Hadzic in Germany. So if you hear a girl shouting at intermission it’s Nicole. (P.S. Nicole did not submit a bio, so this was written by Chloe Evans.)

        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Graphic Designer, Photographer, Captions Operator</h6>
        <p class="card-text">Hanieka is a 4th year Design major, so you could say that graphic design is her passion. Her first exposure to theatre was last semester as the Graphic Designer during New Ren's Stop Kiss. When she’s not designing for class, New Ren, Scout, or her freelance clients, Hanieka can probably be found watching the X Files, reading a book in bed, or going down another Wikipedia rabbit hole.</p>
